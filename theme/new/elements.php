<p>And we have it on good authority that both TDI and hybrid variants
will also come to the States – although the alternative fuel
powertrains aren’t likely to happen right away. While you’re waiting,
check out our high-res galleries below as well as the official press
release. We’re working on uploading video of the new A8 as well, so
check back soon.We’ve just returned from the <a href="http://www.autoblog.com/tag/a8">Audi A8</a>
world premiere here at Miami’s star-studded Design Week, and we’ve got
a slew of images of the new range-topping sedan. More evolutionary than
revolutionary in style, the new wundersedan is nevertheless an
impressive looking piece with the visual charisma to go toe-to-toe with
the celebrities that filed in to fawn over its broad shoulders.</p>
<p><em><strong>Despite the clear heritage link to the outgoing model, </strong></em>there are a number of new technologies under the skin that represent firsts for the brand, including full<strong> LED headlamps that adjust their direction and throw based on </strong>the
navigation system, a new development of MMI that includes a handwriting
recognition feature, and an updated 4.2-liter FSI V8 engine with more
power (372 horses) and an eight-speed Tiptronic gearbox. Despite being
more powerful, the A8 is also more fuel efficient, with a claimed
improvement of 15 percent with the aforementioned gas V8.</p>
